Overview
This README provides basic instructions and information about the login page. The login page is a fundamental component for user authentication.

Features
User authentication: Allows users to log in with their credentials.
Password recovery: Includes a password reset or recovery mechanism.
Customizable design: Can be tailored to match your application's look and feel.
Installation
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and technologies installed, such as a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and a backend framework if required.

Configure your server to serve the login page. You may need to set up a virtual host or configure your web server accordingly.

Set up your database if the login page interacts with one. You will need to define the database schema and connection parameters.

Customize the configuration files (if any) to match your environment. Make sure to update API endpoints, database connections, and other settings as needed.

Usage

Provide your username and password to log in. If you forget your password, use the password recovery feature to reset it.

Once logged in, you will have access to the protected resources or functionalities of your application.

Styling: Modify the CSS files to change the page's appearance.

Logo: Replace the default logo with your own branding logo.

Text: Edit the text and labels to make them more relevant to your application.
